read and pronouns words in Russian and English by syllables. 

### Project Overview:
1. The application will be available on the Play Store for download and install on Android
smartphones.

3. Users can select the preferred language: Russian OR English.
4. Users can select different topics: Animals, Transport, etc.
5. User will select by clicking on buttons with random different syllables to create the whole word
of the displayed image.
6. Users can select the option: Click the button with sound or without. It will read a corresponding
*.mp3 file of the syllable or letter on the button.
7. Allow users to see the hint (help) in case if stuck with the answer.
